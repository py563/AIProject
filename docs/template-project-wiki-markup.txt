!!Concepts Demonstrated
The AI theory used in the game was not covered in class. Guess Who uses a decision tree. A decision tree is a tree in which each branch node represents a choice between a number of  alternatives, and each leaf node represents a decision. In this case, each question asked by the game is a branch node and the answer of either yes or no is a attribute value of that question. After 20 questions, the leaf node is the character guessed by the algorithm.   



!!Innovation
